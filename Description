##  Eniac's Expansion to the Brazilian Market: Investigating Magist

Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy, 
making it an already huge market with even bigger potential for growth. However, Eniac lacks knowledge of the Brazilian market and doesn't have ties with local providers, package delivery services, 
or customer service agencies. The board of directors has demanded the expansion to happen within the next year, and Eniac is considering partnering with Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service company 
that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.

## The Problem

Eniac's catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It's not clear whether the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.
Fast deliveries are key to having happy customers, but the delivery fees resulting from Magist's deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?

## The Solution

Magist is already a big player in the Brazilian market and allows small companies to benefit from its economies of scale. It has signed advantageous contracts with the marketplaces and with the Post Office, 
thus reducing the cost of fees and bureaucracy involved to get things started. Eniac is considering signing a 3-year contract with Magist and operating through external marketplaces as an intermediate step while 
it tests the market, creates brand awareness, and explores the option of opening its own Brazilian marketplace.

## The Data Analysis

Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database to investigate whether it's a good fit to do business with. As a data scientist on this project, you'll be exploring Magist's database to answer the 
following questions:

## Are the marketplaces Magist works with a good place for Eniac's high-end tech products?
## Are the delivery times fast enough to meet Eniac's customer expectations?
